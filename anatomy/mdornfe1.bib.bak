  Abstract                 = {This paper is a contribution to the mathematical analysis of the stability of steady axisymmetric parallel flows of uniform fluid in the absence of rigid boundaries. A jet at sufficiently high Reynolds number for the angle of viscous spreding to be small is the typical example of the primary flows considered, and the theoretical velocity profile far downstream in such a jet is kept in mind continually. It is obvious from experience that such jets are unstable, presumably to infinitesimal disturbances, but there is little observational data about the critical Reynolds number or the mode of disturbance that grows most rapidly at a given Reynolds number.The typical small disturbance considered is a Fourier component with sinusoidal dependence on both ax and nφ (x, r, φ are cylindrical polar co-ordinates). There is no analogue of Squire\&apos;s theorem for two-dimensional primary flows, and both α and n are essential parameters of the disturbance. We have concentrated on the stability characteristics in the limit of large Reynolds number, and have aimed in particular at determining the (integral) value of n at which the growth rate is a maximum in these simpler circumstances.A number of general results for inviscid fluid are established, many of them analogues of corresponding results for two-dimensional primary flow. A necessary condition for the existence of amplified disturbances is that\$Q(r)=rU^{\prime}|(n^2+\alpha ^2 r^2)\$should have a numerical maximum a t some point in the fluid; this condition is satisfied for all n in the case of a cylindrical shear layer or 'top-hat' jet profile (for which a complete solution of the disturbance equation can be obtained), and for n > 1 in the case of a 'far-downstream' jet profile. The wave speed cr of a neutral disturbance is equal to the value of U either a t the point where dQ\&sol;dr = 0 or at r = 0. In the latter case the eigen-function (if one exists) is singular at the axis in general; the former case is presumably relevant to the 'upper branch' of the curve of neutral stability (for given n). The Reynolds stress due to the disturbance acting across a cylindrical surface is examined. Here, as in some other contexts, it is useful to consider components of velocity parallel and perpendicular to a circular helix on which the phase of the disturbance wave is constant. For a neutral disturbance the component of disturbance velocity parallel to the local wave helix is infinite a t the critical point where U = cr, (corresponding to the known singularity for a three-dimensional disturbance to two-dimensional flow), and there is a peak in the Reynolds stress there.It is shown from the form of the disturbance equation that there is an upper limit to the value of n (≠ 0) for a neutral (inviscid) disturbance with cr equal to the value of U at the point where Q′ = 0. In the case of a jet with a 'far-downstream' profile, only the value n = 1 satisfies this restriction; thus only the sinuous mode n = 1 can yield amplified disturbances in an inviscid fluid. A numerical investigation shows that for this profile the wave-number of the neutral disturbance with n = 1 is α = 1·46.},

  Abstract                 = {{
 Adult rats produce two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations referred to as 22- and 50-kHz calls, respectively. Emission of the respective calls represents signaling a negative or positive state of the rat organism. The signaling has an adaptive value for survival and/or well-being of rats and their social groups. Literature is reviewed from studies on cats and rats, which indicates that the positive or negative states constitute a complex and integrated set of somatic, autonomic, endocrine, affective, and cognitive correlates. The basic states and their correlates are initiated, integrated, and maintained by activity of the subsets of the ascending cholinergic and dopaminergic systems originating from the reticular brainstem core. The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems interact mutually to form a dynamic balance, which is involved in a decision-making process of initiating and maintaining one or the other of these states. Activation of the relevant portion of the ascending cholinergic system invariably induces the negative state and releases 22-kHz calls while activation of the ascending dopaminergic system induces the positive state with 50-kHz calls. The 22- and 50-kHz calls have distinct and mostly non-overlapping acoustic parameters, which ensure unambiguous recognition of the calls and thus, the state of the emitter. The animal may only signal one of the states at any given time and emission of 22- or 50-kHz calls is mutually exclusive. It is postulated, therefore, that these two main types of ultrasonic calls are reliable indicator variables of two opposing states of the adult rat organism: negative or positive.

  Abstract                 = {{We analyze the periodically forced Kuramoto model. This system consists of an infinite population of phase oscillators with random intrinsic frequencies, global sinusoidal coupling, and external sinusoidal forcing. It represents an idealization of many phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology in which mutual synchronization competes with forced synchronization. In other words, the oscillators in the population try to synchronize with one another while also trying to lock onto an external drive. Previous work on the forced Kuramoto model uncovered two main types of attractors, called forced entrainment and mutual entrainment, but the details of the bifurcations between them were unclear. Here we present a complete bifurcation analysis of the model for a special case in which the infinite-dimensional dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system. Exact results are obtained for the locations of Hopf, saddle-node, and Takens–Bogdanov bifurcations. The resulting stability diagram bears a striking resemblance to that for the weakly nonlinear forced van der Pol oscillator.}},

Am. 54, 1554 (1973)] of the mechanism of interaction between a time‐varying air jet flow velocity and a resonant organ pipe is extended to deal with the case in which a jet of fixed flow velocity is deflected to cut a sharp pipe lip. Similar terms arise in the analysis but the nonlinearities are less important than in Elder's case. The generation of higher transverse pipe modes by the jet asymmetry is considered and it is concluded that such modes may play a significant part in coupling ordinary pipe modes to pipe‐wall vibrations.Subject Classification: [43]75.60.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat larynx was studied with particular attention to myology and neuromuscular structures to further validate it as a model to evaluate morphologic and functional changes induced by botulinum injection. A laryngeal alar cartilage (LAlC), alar cricoarytenoid (ACA) muscle, and a superior cricoarytenoid muscle (SCA) were identified as anatomic structures not previously described. Two portions (medial and lateral) of the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) were distinguished. The function of the ACA was suggested to be similar to the aryepiglottis muscle in humans and the function of the SCA was suggested to be similar to the human interarytenoid muscle. The predominant pattern of motor endplate (MEP) distribution in rat laryngeal muscles (posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, cricothyroid, and SCA) was to have MEPs concentrated mostly at the midbelly of muscle where they were distributed throughout the cross-sectional area of the midbelly. The TA and ACA differed from this pattern. The lateral TA had MEPs concentrated at the anterior third of its belly and those of the medial TA were located at the midbelly. Motor endplates in the ACA were located mostly at the posterior portion of muscle. Muscle fiber-typing showed subtle differences between the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Fast fibers were predominant in the rat laryngeal muscles. This study supports the expanded use of rats in studies of laryngeal neuromuscular function and disease in humans.}},

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the rat larynx is capable of producing ultrasounds with the full range of frequencies reported in vivo. Acoustic output of excised rat larynges with and without vocal fold constriction was measured. At biologically-reasonable airflow rates and pressures, only larynges with a constriction produced the full range of ultrasounds reported in vivo, providing support for the hypothesis that a constriction within the larynx is likely the source of rat USVs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Vocal production requires complex planning and coordination of respiratory, laryngeal and vocal tract movements, which are incompletely understood in most mammals. Rats produce a variety of whistles in the ultrasonic range which are of communicative relevance and of importance as model system, but the sources of acoustic variability were mostly unknown. The goal was to identify sources of fundamental frequency variability. Subglottal pressure, tracheal airflow and electromyographic data from two intrinsic laryngeal muscles measured during 22-kHz and 50-kHz call production in awake, spontaneously behaving adult male rats. During ultrasound vocalization, subglottal pressure ranged between 0.8 and 1.9 kPa. Pressure differences between call types were not significant. The relation between fundamental frequency and subglottal pressure within call types was inconsistent. Experimental manipulations of subglottal pressure had only small effects on fundamental frequency. Tracheal airflow patterns were also inconsistently associated with frequency. Pressure and flow seem to play a small role in regulation of fundamental frequency. Muscle activity, however, is precisely regulated and very sensitive to alterations, presumably due to effects on resonance properties in the vocal tract. EMG activity of cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscle was tonic in calls with slow or no fundamental frequency modulations, like 22-kHz and flat 50-kHz calls. Both muscles showed brief high-amplitude, alternating bursts at rates up to 150 Hz during production of frequency modulated 50-kHz calls. A differentiated and fine regulation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles is critical for normal ultrasound vocalization. Many features of the laryngeal muscle activation pattern during ultrasound vocalization in rats is shared with other mammals.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In human speech, the sound generated by the larynx is modified by articulatory movements of the upper vocal tract, which acts as a variable resonant filter concentrating energy near particular frequencies, or formants, essential in speech recognition. Despite its potential importance in vocal communication, little is known about the presence of tunable vocal tract filters in other vertebrates. The tonal quality of much birdsong, in which upper harmonics have relatively little energy, depends on filtering of the vocal source, but the nature of this filter is controversial. Current hypotheses treat the songbird vocal tract as a rigid tube with a resonance that is modulated by the end-correction of a variable beak opening. Through x-ray cinematography of singing birds, we show that birdsong is accompanied by cyclical movements of the hyoid skeleton and changes in the diameter of the cranial end of the esophagus that maintain an inverse relationship between the volume of the oropharyngeal cavity and esophagus and the song's fundamental frequency. A computational acoustic model indicates that this song-related motor pattern tunes the major resonance of the oropharyngeal–esophageal cavity to actively track the song's fundamental frequency.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Across mammals many vocal sounds are produced by airflow induced vocal fold oscillation. We tested the hypothesis that stress–strain and stress-relaxation behavior of rat vocal folds can be used to predict the fundamental frequency range of the species' vocal repertoire. In a first approximation vocal fold oscillation has been modeled by the string model but it is not known whether this concept equally applies to large and small species. The shorter the vocal fold, the more the ideal string law may underestimate normal mode frequencies. To accommodate the very small size of the tissue specimen, a custom-built miniaturized tensile test apparatus was developed. Tissue properties of 6 male rat vocal folds were measured. Rat vocal folds demonstrated the typical linear stress–strain behavior in the low strain region and an exponential stress response at strains larger than about 40\%. Approximating the rat's vocal fold oscillation with the string model suggests that fundamental frequencies up to about 6 kHz can be produced, which agrees with frequencies reported for audible rat vocalization. Individual differences and time-dependent changes in the tissue properties parallel findings in other species, and are interpreted as universal features of the laryngeal sound source.}},

Ultrasonic cries were found to be emitted mainly through the mouth, with no evidence for the involvement of cavity resonances. Nerve sectioning experiments on adult and young rats implicated the larynx as the source of both their audible and their ultrasonic cries. However, consideration of the considerable differences in physical structure between the typically ” vocal” audible cries and the ultrasonic cries, as well as other differences noted in the experimental conditions here and elsewhere, leads to the conclusion that the rodent larynx may operate in two quite different sound production modes.}},

Consideration of the patterns found and possible laryngeal mechanisms may help to explain the origin of the ultrasounds which differ considerably in physical structure from the typically ” vocal” audible cries. Echolocation cries of the constant frequency bat Rhinolophus luctus were always associated with expiration, whereas the much shorter cries of two vespertilionids, Eptesicus serotinus and Plecotus auritus, although occurring at the onset of expiration at low repetition rates, could occur throughout the respiratory cycle at the highest rates recorded. The patterns found may well be adapted for the echolocation requirements of these bats. Using a simpler technique the long ultrasounds of adult rats were also found to be associated with expiration.}},

We introduce a method, based on nonlinear state space reconstruction, that can distinguish causality from correlation. It extends to nonseparable weakly connected dynamic systems (cases not covered by the current Granger causality paradigm). The approach is illustrated both by simple models (where, in contrast to the real world, we know the underlying equations/relations and so can check the validity of our method) and by application to real ecological systems, including the controversial sardine-anchovy-temperature problem.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Rationale  50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by adult rats are heterogeneous; they occur over a wide frequency range, show varying degrees of frequency modulation, and appear to differ in their behavioral significance. However, they have not been extensively categorized. Objectives  The main objective of this study was to identify subtypes of 50-kHz USVs emitted by adult rats and to determine how amphetamine (AMPH) or social testing condition affects their relative and absolute production rate and acoustic characteristics. A second objective was to determine the extent of individual differences in call rate, call subtype profile, and acoustic parameters (i.e., duration, bandwidth, and mean peak frequency). Methods  Adult male Long–Evans rats were administered systemic amphetamine (0.25–2 mg/kg, IP) and tested individually or with a cage mate for 20 min. Call categories were defined based on visual inspection of over 20,000 USV spectrograms. Surgical devocalization was performed on a subset of AMPH-tested rats in order to confirm the authenticity of call subtypes. Results  Fourteen categories of 50-kHz USVs were recognized. Call subtypes were differentially affected by social context, AMPH dose, and time within session. In contrast, the acoustic characteristics of call subtypes were notably stable. Marked and stable inter-individual differences occurred with respect to overall 50-kHz call rate, acoustic parameters, and call profile. Conclusions  The present findings, obtained under saline and amphetamine test conditions, provide the first detailed classification of adult rat 50-kHz USVs. Consideration of 50-kHz USV subtypes may advance our understanding of inter-rat communication and affective state.}},
